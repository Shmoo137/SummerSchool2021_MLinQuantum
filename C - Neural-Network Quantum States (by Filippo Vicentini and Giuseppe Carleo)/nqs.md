## Hands-on Tutorial C: Neural-Network Quantum States (by Filippo Vicentini and Giuseppe Carleo)
Folder "C - Neural-Network States (by Giuseppe Carleo)" contains:
- a Jupyter notebook `00_Introduction_to_JAX.ipynb` which is an introductory notebook about Jax, talking a bit about everything and terminating with an example of a linear regression (a useful addition that was not covered during the school in Warsaw).
- a Jupyter notebook `01_Introduction_to_NetKet.ipynb` which introduces the syntax of ["NetKet 3"](https://www.netket.org/), a very useful library for studies of many-body quantum systems with neural networks and ML techniques, on the example of the Ising model,
- a Jupyter notebook `02_Dynamics_with_NetKet.ipynb` which was the basis of ["Filippo Vicentini's lecture"](https://youtu.be/Ryz-o71tuy8).
All notebooks were prepared by Filippo Vicentini and accompanied the lectures of Giuseppe Carleo.
