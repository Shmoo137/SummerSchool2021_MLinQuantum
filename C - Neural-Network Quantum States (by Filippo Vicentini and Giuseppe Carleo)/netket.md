## Jupter notebooks were prepared by Dr. Filippo Vicentini:
- Jupyter notebook `1-JAX` is an introductory notebook about Jax, talking a bit about everything and terminating with an example of a linear regression (a useful addition that was not covered during the school in Warsaw).
- Jupyter notebook `2-nqs-ising` is the first tutorial covered during the school introducing NetKet and solving the Ising model 
- Jupyter notebook `3-dynamics` contains the second tutorial about the dynamics.
